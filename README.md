# Network Intrusion Detection – Data Analysis and Machine Learning 
Project

## Project Overview
This project analyzes network traffic data to identify malicious activity using
machine learning techniques. The goal is to demonstrate data preprocessing,
feature engineering, exploratory analysis, and model evaluation skills.

## Dataset
- NSL-KDD dataset
- 41 network traffic features
- Binary classification: Normal vs Attack

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn

## Key Data Analysis Steps
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Handling categorical and numerical variables
- Feature scaling and encoding
- Correlation analysis and visualizations
- Model performance evaluation

## Results
- Accuracy: 75%
- Precision (Attack): 92%
- Recall (Attack): 62%
- Key insight: High precision but moderate recall, indicating missed attacks

## Business Insight
Reducing false negatives is critical in intrusion detection as missed attacks
can lead to severe security risks. The analysis suggests future improvements
using class balancing and advanced models.
